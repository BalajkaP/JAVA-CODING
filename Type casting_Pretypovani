What is the function of (HttpURLConnection) inside this code: HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection():

The (HttpURLConnection) is a type casting operation. It is used to cast the result of url.openConnection() to the HttpURLConnection type.

The url.openConnection() method returns a generic URLConnection object. However, in many cases, you know that the connection
you are creating is an HTTP connection, and you want to work with the specific features and methods of HttpURLConnection,
which is a subclass of URLConnection specialized for HTTP connections.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So, by using (HttpURLConnection), you are essentially telling the Java compiler to treat the URLConnection object returned by
url.openConnection() as an HttpURLConnection object. This allows you to access the specific HTTP-related methods and properties
provided by HttpURLConnection, such as setting the request method, handling response codes, and more.

In summary, the (HttpURLConnection) casting operation is used to convert the generic URLConnection object to an
HttpURLConnection object so that you can work with HTTP-specific features when making HTTP requests and handling responses.
